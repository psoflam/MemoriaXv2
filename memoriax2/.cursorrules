# .cursor or prompt preamble rules
- Always reference 'The Goal/MemoriaX_Planning.txt' for project structure, terminology, and specification details.
- Prioritize local memory tracking and emotion-aware interactions in all relevant logic.
- Ensure all code aligns with the MemoriaX core goals defined in 'The Goal/MemoriaX_Planning.txt'.
- Use `README.md` for current status, modules in progress, and known limitations.
- Follow `PEP8` and the `Google Python Style Guide` strictly across all files.
- Use `memory.db` as the default local persistence target unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- For TODO sections like `1.1`, complete **all sub-items (1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.) as a unified implementation plan**.
- Treat each task group (e.g., `1.2.*`, `1.3.*`) as a **single feature module**â€”use consistent structure and naming.
- Use MemoryX2 as the project folder for all changes to files.
